      <description>Coin-Flip GameSuppose a fair coin is flipped 10 times, how many of the flips will result in heads? Since heads and tails are equally likely, you might say half of the flips will be heads and half will be tails. Suppose we bet that I give you 100 dollars if you guessed right and you give me 100 dollars otherwise. How would you decide whether to take the bet?</description>

      <description>Software EnvironmentWe will be using the R programming language to implement our simulation strategies. R is open source and has powerful libraries to make certain data analysis tasks very easy. We will make use of the purrr package, however, you can ignore it and go through the entire post. I only used it at the later part of the miscellaneous section to make the reader consider itâ€™s functional programming capabilities.</description>
